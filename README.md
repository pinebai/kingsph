# kingsph

This is my toy SPH code. It is "based" on this: http://www.arxiv.org/abs/1012.1885 paper by Price, and his Ph.D. thesis.

Different subroutines for initial conditions for:

1d sod
2d sedov 
3d sedov
2d something...

Cubic kernel, leapfrog time integration, variable smoothing length.

Boundary conditions are bodged for the time being.
